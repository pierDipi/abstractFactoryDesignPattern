# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

Abstract Factory Design Pattern 

___

> **Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.**

___


> ### Applicability 
> * Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:
>   * a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented. 
>   * a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products. 
>   * a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint. 
>   * you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.
